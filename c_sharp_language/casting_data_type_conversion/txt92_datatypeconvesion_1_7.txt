//Implicit & Explicit conversion

//Implicit conversion is done by the compiler:
//1. When there is no loss of information if the conversion is done
//2.if there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion

//Example: Converting an int to a float will not loose any data and no exception will be thrown, 
//hence an implicit conversion can be done.

//Where as when converting a float to an int, we loose the fractional part and also
//a possibility of overflow exception. Hence, in this case an explicit conversion is required. For
//explicit conversion we can use cast operator or covert class in C#
