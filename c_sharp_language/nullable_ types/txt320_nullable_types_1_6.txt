//in c# types are divided into 2 broad categories
//Value types - int, float, double, structs, enums etc
//Reference type - Interface, class, delegates, arrays etc

//By default values types are non nullable. To make them nullable use?
//int i = 0 (i is non nullable, so i cannot be set to mull, i =null will generate compiler error)
//int? j = 0(j is nullable int, so j=jull is legal)

//Nullable types bridge the difference between C# types and Database types
