Another way to acheive this Buffer class to work with doubles and strings is to give its own implementation to it.

class MyClassStr
{
	private int _start = 0;
	public int BufferProperty  { get; set; }

	private string[] _bufferArray;

	public Buffer(int capacity)
	{
		_bufferArray = new string[capacity];
	}

	public void Write(string value)
	{ _bufferArray[0] = value; }

	public string Read()
	{ return _bufferArray[0]; }
}

Like this way we can implement a class for double also. But making classes like this is not a good idea for maintaining the code.

Instead what we have to do is parameterize the datatype of the class. So we don't have to create seperate classes for everything.
