Differences between IEnumerable and IEnumerator :

IEnumerable uses IEnumerator internally.
IEnumerable doesnt know which item/object is executing.
Whenever we pass IEnumerator to another function ,it knows the current position of item/object.
Whenever we pass IEnumerable collection to another function ,it doesn't know the current position of item/object(doesn't know which item its executing)
