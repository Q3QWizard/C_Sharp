Dynamic
-------

c# is not a dynamically typed even though you can have dynamic types. It's statically typed dynamic type.

ExpandoObject is the object that use with the dynamic keyword (contextual keyword) in order to add properties and
method dynamically
	contextual keyword - is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it is not a reserved word in c#
	
Dynamics are eveluated at runtime

dynamic person = new ExpandoObject();
person.Name = "Fill";
person.Age = 24;

ExpandoObject implements the interface Dictionary<string, object> with this we can do following.

dynamic person = new ExpandoObject();
var dictionary = (IDictionary<string, object>)person;

dictionary.Add("Name", "Fill");
dictionary.Add("Age", 24);

This is how you add dynamic properties. But how about adding method?

dictionary.Add("Shout", new Action(() => { Console.WriteLine("Heloooooo");}));
