/*
 A dynamic type changes its type at runtime based on the value of the expression to the right of the "=" operator
 * 
 * If we comment out the FakeMethod decleration there will be no compiletime exception but in runtime there will be exception.
 * 
 * dynamic types are resolved at runtime instead of compile time.
 * 
 * the compiler skips the type checking for dynamic type. so it doesn't give any error about dynamic types at the compile time.
 * 
 * The dynamic type doesn't have intellisense support in VS.
 * 
 * A method can have parameters of dynamic type.
