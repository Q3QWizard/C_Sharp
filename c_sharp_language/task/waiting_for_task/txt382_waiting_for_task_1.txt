/*
 * 1.
 You can use Thread.Sleep(5000) to stop execution of a task for some time.
 By doing that way it tells that execution I dont need processing and some one
 else can have the processing power. So if we use Thread.Sleep(5000) sheduler can get
 another task and executing as you sleep which is great.
