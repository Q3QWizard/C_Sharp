out variables
-------------

The existing syntax that supports out parameters has been improved in this version. You can now declare 
out variables in the argument list of a method call, rather than writing a separate declaration statement:

if (int.TryParse(input, out int result))
    Console.WriteLine(result);
else
    Console.WriteLine("Could not parse input");
	
You may want to specify the type of the out variable for clarity, as shown above. However, the language does support 
using an implicitly typed local variable:

if (int.TryParse(input, out var answer))
    Console.WriteLine(answer);
else
    Console.WriteLine("Could not parse input");
	
The code is easier to read.
	You declare the out variable where you use it, not on another line above.
No need to assign an initial value.
	By declaring the out variable where it's used in a method call, you can't accidentally use it before it is assigned.
