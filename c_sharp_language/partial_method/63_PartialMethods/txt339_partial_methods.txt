A partial class or struct can contain partial methods

A partial method is created using the partial keyword.

A partial method declaration consists of two parts.
	The definition(only the method signature)
	The implementation
These may be in separate parts of a partial class, or in the same part.

The implementation for a partial method is optional. If we don't provide the implementation, the compiler removes the 
signature and all the calls to the method.

Partial methods are private by default. and it is a compile time error to include any access modifiers, including private.

It is a compile time error, to include declaration and implementation at the same time for a partial method.

A partial method returns type must be void. Including any other return type is a compile time error. 

Signature of the partial method declaration, must match with the signature of the implementation.

A partial method must be declared within a partial class or partial struct. A non partial class or struct cannot include partial methods.

A partial method can be implemented only once. Trying to implement a partial method more than once, raises a compile time error.
