Single expression must return value of method's return type if method is not void type

class Operations
{
	public int Num1 = 100;
	public int Num2 = 33;
	
	//method that writes to console
	public void Display () => Console.WriteLine("Hello Buddy");
	
	// method that call another method
	public void Called => Display();
	
	// method that has 2 parameters and return their sum. REturn keyword is not required when implement
	public int Addition(int a, int b) => a + b + 100;
	
	//Method that has two parameters and return value according. Return keyword is not required when implement
	pubilc int Compare(int a, int b) => a == b ? 100 : 200;
	
	
}

Expression or right side followed with => must be valid statement. Only assignment, call, increment, decrement, and
new object expression can be used as a statement. Also statement must return value of method's return type if
