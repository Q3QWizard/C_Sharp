Expression bodied technique can be used to define get accessor. Return keyword
is not required for 'get' accessor.

class Operations
{
	public int num1 = 100;
	public int num2 = 33;
	private string name;
	
	public string Name
	{
		get => name;
	}
}

Expression or right side followed with => must be a valid single statement and must return a value of data type
defined in the property.
