//Static vs Instance methods

//When a method declaration includes a static modifier, that method is said to be a static method.
//when no static modifier is present, the method is said to be an instance method

//Static method is involved using the class name, where as an instance method is involved using
//an instance of the class

//The difference between instance methods and static methods is that multiple instances of a class
// can be created (or instantiated) and each instance has its own separate method. However, when
//a method is static, there are no instances of that method, and you can invoke only that one 
//definition of the static method.
