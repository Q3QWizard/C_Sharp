// A class consisted of data and behaviour. Class data is represented by it's fields and behaviour
//represented by its methods.

//Purpose of a class constructor

// The purpose of a class constructor is to initialize class fields. A class is 
//automatically called when an instance of a class is created.

// Constructors do not have return values and always have the same name as the class

// Constructors are not mandatory. If we do not provide a constructor. a default parameter
// less constructor is automatically provided.

// Constructors can be overloaded by the number and type of parameters
