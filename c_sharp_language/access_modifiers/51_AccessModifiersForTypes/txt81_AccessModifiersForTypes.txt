In c# there are 5 different access modifiers

	1. Private
	2. Public 
	3. Protected
	4. Internal
	5. Protected Internal
	
You can use all 5 access modifiers with type members, but types allows only
internal and public access modifiers. It is a compile time error to use private,
protected and protected internal access modifiers with types

public 							Anywhere, No restrictions.

protected						With in the containing type and the types derived from the containing type
