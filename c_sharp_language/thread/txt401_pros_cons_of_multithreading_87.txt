Advantages of multithreading

1. To maintain a responsive interface
2. To make efficient use of processor time while waiting for I/O operations to complete
3. To split large, CPU-bound tasks to be processed simultaneously on a machine that has multiple processors/ cores

Disadvantages of multithreading

1. On a single processor/ core machine threading affects performance negatively as there is overhead involved with context-switching

2. Have to write more lines of code to accomplish the same task.

3. Multithreaded applications are difficult to write, understand, debug and maintain
