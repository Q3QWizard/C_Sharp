/*

 *  Predicate is a extend to the Func
 *  You can have inputs as well as outputs
 *  It is only for checking, to ckeck weather something is true and false
 *  Predicate always return type of boolean and it can take any input type
 *  
 * Func, Action, Predicate are ready made delegates
 * 
 * Functions is used to point towards methods where input type can be anything and output type can be anything
 * Action is used to point towards methods where there is input type and return type is void
 * Predicate is used to point towards method where input type is anyting and return type is boolean
