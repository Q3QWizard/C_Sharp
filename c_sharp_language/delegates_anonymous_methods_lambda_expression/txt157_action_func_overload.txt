Overload c# 6.0
---------------

The process in which the compiler overload has been improved in c# 6.0. It's little bit smarter when choosing which
overload is more appropriate for certain arguments.

In ealier version of vs-2013 following code will generate an compiler time error

private static void TEst_OverloadResolution()
{
	int paymentToAgent = ProcessPayment(CalculateFunction);
	
	Console.WriteLine(paymentToAgent);
	Console.Read();
}

private static void ProcessPayment(Action action){}

private static int ProcessPayment(Func<int> item){ return item(); }

public static int CalculateFunction()
{
	return 1000;
}

This error raised because before c# 6.0 the return type is not considered when use in like this context. But in c# 6.0 correct it.
