You can also provide a similar deconstruction for any type in .NET. You write a Deconstruct method as a member of the 
class. That Deconstruct method provides a set of out arguments for each of the properties you want to extract. 
Consider this Point class that provides a deconstructor method that extracts the X and Y coordinates:

using System;
using System.Collections;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Point p = new Point(10, 15);
        var(x, y) = p;

        Console.WriteLine(x);
        Console.WriteLine(y);
    }
}

public class Point
{
    public Point(double x, double y) 
        => (X, Y) = (x, y);

    public double X { get; }
    public double Y { get; }

    public void Deconstruct(out double x, out double y) =>
        (x, y) = (X, Y);
}
