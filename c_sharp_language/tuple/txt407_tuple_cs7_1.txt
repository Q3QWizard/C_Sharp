Tuples are lightweight data structures that contain multiple fields to represent the data members. 
The fields aren't validated, and you can't define your own methods
 
(string Alpha, string Beta) namedLetters = ("a", "b");
Console.WriteLine($"{namedLetters.Alpha}, {namedLetters.Beta}");

The namedLetters tuple contains fields referred to as Alpha and Beta. 
Those names exist only at compile time and aren't preserved, for example when inspecting the tuple using reflection at runtime.

In a tuple assignment, you can also specify the names of the fields on the right-hand side of the assignment:

var alphabetStart = (Alpha: "a", Beta: "b");
Console.WriteLine($"{alphabetStart.Alpha}, {alphabetStart.Beta}");
