/*
 IS keyword is useful when you want to check, if two objects are of the same type or not.
 AS keyword is useful when you want to type cast, one object to the other type.
 
 As assign null if the x is not a string. For this reason you cannot use it will the value types.(The operator could never return null in that case).
