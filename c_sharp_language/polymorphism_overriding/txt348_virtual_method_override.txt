Is it neccessary to override virtual method in base class?
	
	A virtual method is the method which is declared with the keyword virtual, and it can be override by the derived class method by using override
	keyword. It's up to the derived class whether to override it or not.
	
Can we create virtual method in abstract class?
	
	Yes, we can have virtual methods in abstract class in c#. This is true that both virtual and abstract methods allow derived classes to override and implement it.
	But the difference is that a abstract method foreces derived class to implement it where as virtual method is optional.
