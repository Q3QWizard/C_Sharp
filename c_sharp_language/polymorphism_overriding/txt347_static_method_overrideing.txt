Static methods can not overriden. They can however be hidden using the new keyword.

Mostly overriding methods means you reference a base type and want to call derived method.

Method overriding is possible only in derived classes.
A method must be a non-virtual or static method for override.
Both the override method and the virtual method must have the same access level modifiers.

class A
{
	public static void MyMethod() => Console.Write("Base class static method");
}

class B : A{}

svm
{
	B.MyMeth();
}
