The override modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of inherited method, property, indexer or event.

overriden method - base class method
override method - child class method

The method that is overriden by an override declaration is known as overriden base method.

The overriden base method must have the same signature as the override method.

You can not override a non-virtual, or static method. The overriden base method must be virtual, abstract or override

As override declaration can not change the accessibility of the virtual method. Both the override method and the virtual method must have the same
access level modifier.

Can not use the new, static or virtual modifiers to modify an override method.

An override property declaration must specify exactly the same access modifier, type, and name as the inherited property, and the overriden property
must be virtual, abstract, or override.
