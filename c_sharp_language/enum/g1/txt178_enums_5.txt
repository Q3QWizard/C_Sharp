/*
 Enums

If a program uses set of integral numbers, consider replacing them with enums, which makes the program more
	Readable
	Maintainable
	
1. Enums are enumerations.

2. Enums are strongly type and vice versa. Also, an enum of one type cannot be implicitly assigned to an enum
	of another type even though the underlying value of their members are the same.

3. The default underlying type of an enum is int.

4. The default value for first element is ZERO  and gets incremented by 1.

5. It is possible to customize the underlying type and values.

6. Enums are value types.

7. Enum keyword (all small letters) is used to create enumerations. Where as Enum class, contains 
	static GetValues() and GetNames() methods which can be used to list Enum underlying type values and Names.
