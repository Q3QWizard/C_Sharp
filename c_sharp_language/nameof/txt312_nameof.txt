/*
 C# 6.0
 
 What about cases where you want to reuse the name of a property, for example when throwing exception based on a property name, or handling a PropertyChanged event. There are numerous cases where you would want to have the name of the property.

Take this example:

switch (e.PropertyName)
{
    case nameof(SomeProperty):
    { break };

    // opposed to
    case "SomeOtherProperty":
    { break;}
}
In the first case, renaming SomeProperty will change the name of the property too, or it will break compilation. The last case doesn't.

This is a very useful way to keep your code compiling and bug free (sort-of).
