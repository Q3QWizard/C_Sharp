If we rename the thePeople variable using select word right click and then rename or select the word C+R,R.
By default VS will not rename inside string unless if we don't tick include in string in rename dialog box.

In c# 6.0 there is a better way to do this. That's where nameOf operator comes in to play

throw new ArgumentNullException(nameOf(thePeople), "the parameter passed is null");

Note:- 
	nameOf operator works with in scope. If we had a variable out of the scope of the Test_NameOf function then
	those variables cannot be accessed via nameOf
	
	If you use it inside summary comment renameing will not rename nameOf variable inside summary comment to rename it
	use Include comments in rename window.
